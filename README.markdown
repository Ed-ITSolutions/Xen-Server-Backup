# Xen Sever Backup

Backup Xen Virtual Machines from the xenserver to another machine.

# Usage

Our modifications to this script are the ability to backup virtual machines minus one or more of the hard drives, so that the backups don't include data drives etc...

To prevent a disk from being backed up by this script place 'nobackup' at the end of is description.
